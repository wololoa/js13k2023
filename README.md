This game uses [ZzFX](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX) and [lightgl.js](https://github.com/evanw/lightgl.js/).   

In the /assets folder you will find the png spritesheet as well as two songs  
created in [soundbox](https://sb.bitsnbites.eu/) (that sadly didn't fit the game).  

**Many thanks** to @jacklehamster for helping with soundbox, and   
IVB, Reisor, Caldo & co. for testing the game and all the lovely  
contestants that share their wisdom and help over Discord.
